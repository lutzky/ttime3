/**
 * Layered objects for avoiding collisions
 *
 * Explanation: Suppose you have objects A, B, C, that collide like so (time
 * being horizontal):
 *
 *    [AAAAAAA]
 * [BBBBBB]
 *         [CCCCCC]
 *
 * Because the collisions are A-B and A-C (but never B-C), they can be laid
 * out, for example, like so:
 *
 * [BBBBBB][CCCCCC]
 *    [AAAAAAA]
 *
 * In this case, the numLayers for all events is 2, B and C are on layer 0, and
 * A is on layer 1. If C were to start a bit earlier, though, three layers would
 * be needed:
 *
 * [BBBBBB]
 *      [CCCCCC]
 *    [AAAAAAA]
 *
 * In this case the numLayers for all events is 3, and B, C, and A are on layers
 * 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
